# DIY CNC router with work area around 400x600mm 

Hi everyone! It's my first attempt to model CNC router in CAD software. Work still in progress, but CAD pretty much done. 

[Current state screenshot](https://github.com/Shkolik/CNC4060/raw/main/docs/Full%20assembly.png)

# Materials

Router made of 10 series fractional aluminum extrusion profiles and aluminum flat stock. Base made of 2 2"x4" side profiles and 4 2"x2" cross members. Gantry made of 2 2"x2" profiles that tied together with 1/2" aluminum plate. All sizes and shapes made to fit widely available flat stock.

Fasteners are mix of metric and imperial threads just because all linear motion hardware use metric, but fractional extrusion wants imperial. You can use all metric, but it will require some additional work.


# CAD
